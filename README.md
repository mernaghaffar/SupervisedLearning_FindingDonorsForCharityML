In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimized this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
